# Animal Classification Model

This repository contains a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying animals from the Animals-10 dataset. The model is trained to recognize images of 10 different animal species. The goal is to create an image classification pipeline that can identify animals in images and match them with the entities recognized in text using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model.
