# Animal Classification Model

This repository contains a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying animals from the Animals-10 dataset. The model is trained to recognize images of 10 different animal species. The goal is to create an image classification pipeline that can identify animals in images and match them with the entities recognized in text using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model.

The model is trained on the Animals-10 dataset, which contains 10 different animal classes. The dataset includes images of the following animals:

Cat
Dog
Cow
Horse
Elephant
Zebra
Lion
Tiger
Bear
Giraffe
